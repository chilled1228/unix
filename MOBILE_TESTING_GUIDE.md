### Debugging Mobile Issues

#### Common Solutions
- **Text too small**: Increase base font size to 16px minimum

- **Horizontal scrolling**: Check for fixed widths, use max-width: 100%
- **iOS zoom on input**: Set font-size: 16px on inputs
- **Performance issues**: Optimize images, minimize JavaScript

#### Development Tools
- Use Chrome DevTools device simulation
- Enable "Show rulers" to check touch target sizes
- Use "Network" tab to test on slow connections
- Check "Console" for mobile-specific errors

### Brand Color Consistency on Mobile

Ensure all mobile-specific styles use brand colors:
- Navigation: `brand-secondary-*` colors
- Buttons: `brand-primary-*` colors
- Backgrounds: `brand-secondary-50` for light backgrounds
- Text: `brand-secondary-900` for dark text, `brand-secondary-600` for secondary text
