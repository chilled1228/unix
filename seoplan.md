```
Unix timestamp, also known as Unix time, POSIX time, or Epoch time, represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This system provides a standardized way to track time across different computer systems and programming languages.

The Unix epoch (January 1, 1970) serves as the reference point because it coincides with the release of Unix version 1. All Unix timestamps are calculated as the difference between the desired date/time and this epoch moment.
```
